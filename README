SA:MP Gamemode Development Kit for C++
======================================

What's this?
-------------------

The SA:MP GDK allows you to easily create SA:MP gamemodes in C++ loading them as server plugins.
GDK is basically a wrapper around SA:MP native scripting functions and callbacks. 

Getting started 
-------------------

### Download the source ###

You have two options:

1) Download the source archive from https://github.com/Zeex/sampgdk/downloads 
2) Clone the repository with Git: `git clone git://github.com/Zeex/sampgdk.git`

### Add to your project ###

There are ready-to-use project files for some popular IDE's, you can find them in `build/<os-name>/<tool-name>`. 
Generally it is recommended that you use these to build GDK (as a static library) and link against it. 

For example, if you're using Visual Studio 2010, just add `build/windows/vs2010/sampgdk.vcxproj` 
to your Solution (the .sln) and set up include/library paths via Project Properties dialog. 

### Write some code ###

If you are new to GDK you might want to look at the helloworld example first, it will teach you some basics.
